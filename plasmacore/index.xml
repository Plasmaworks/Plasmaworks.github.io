			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Plasmaworks, the game publisher and technology engineering company.  If you&#8217;re looking for our games, they&#8217;re alive and well at <a href="http://www.castlearcadium.com">Castle Arcadium</a>, our digital entertainment brand!</p>
<p>A few months ago we decided that we were just appearing too schizophrenic &#8211; are we a game developer that also writes languages and does contract work, or are we a technology developer that dabbles in games?</p>
<p>Well, both and neither.  And it doesn&#8217;t really matter to &#8221;us&#8221; &#8211; we know what we are &#8211; but the brand becomes diluted.  Thus we&#8217;ve spun off Castle Arcadium as our dedicated games brand and we&#8217;re refocusing Plasmaworks as a developer-centric, tech heavy hangout.  It&#8217;s still in transition &#8211; bear with us!</p>

<p><span id="more-242"></span></p>
<p><em>Silo</em> is an arcade RTS that could be described as <em>Missile Command</em> meets <em>Galcon.</em> Developed by <em>Riverman Media</em>, <em>Silo </em>is a AAA single player iPhone title that features gorgeous graphics, vibrant sounds, and an extensive campaign scenario.  Send out transports to take over territories, build defense systems, upgrade your arsenal, and launch nuclear missiles!!</p>
<p><em>Mr Gibs vs the Deathatron</em> is a fun and frantic arcade game with simple controls and addictive challenge.  As the Deathatron launches all manner of weapons at you, just tap to stand in a safe spot.  As the action heats up, only one thing is certain: you&#8217;re going to die.  But how long can you last?  The game features national and global scoreboards for bragging rights!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April 3, 2010 &#8211; Plasmaworks announced they have two iPad launch titles: <em>Egyptian Triad</em> and <em>Air Hockey Plasma</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-185"></span></p>
<p><em>Egyptian Triad</em> is a collection of three board games that were originally popular in ancient Egypt: <em>Hounds &amp; Jackals, Senet, </em>and <em>Mehen.</em> The first two games are two player and the last supports 2-4 players &#8211; in all cases, either human or AI opponents can be chosen.  All the games have path-progression mechanics similar to <em>Sorry!</em> or <em>Parcheesi</em> with die-based movement, safe zones, and slides.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very excited about the iPad&#8217;s potential to supplement, integrate with, and even replace traditional table-top gaming,&#8221; said Abe Pralle, Plasmaworks Technology Director.  &#8220;We&#8217;ve finally got a device that can just sit on the table and be the gameplay board, and more importantly keep track of the rules and pieces so the players don&#8217;t have to.  We&#8217;re starting with a set of simple and fun family games, but we&#8217;re definitely going to explore just how far we can take this concept.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Air Hockey Plasma</em> is Plasmaworks&#8217; take on air hockey.  Lead programmer Steve Worsley commented on why Plasmaworks chose to enter a market already crowding with implementations of air hockey for the iPad: &#8220;<em>All</em> I want to do is play a good game of air hockey &#8211; I don&#8217;t care who makes it.  With most of [the iPhone air hockey apps] you&#8217;ve got either poor physics, poor graphics, or retarded AI.  I just made the game I wanted to play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both games are now available.  <em>Egyptian Trio </em>sells for $2.99 and <em>Air Hockey Plasma</em> is priced at $0.99.  Screenshots are posted on plasmaworks.com.</p>
<p>Plasmaworks is a developer of casual and hard-core casual games for iPad, iPhone, Android, and Palm platforms.  Previous titles include <em>Deathride, Zombie Conga</em>, and <em>Fish Hunter.</em></p>
