</li></ul>
<ul><li> To upgrade an existing 3.0.x project, just run gogo "upgrade" once to install the new Plasmacore and again to update installed modules.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> To upgrade an earlier Plasmacore project, unzip the file above and place the "new_project" folder in the "upgrade" folder of your existing project and run GoGo.  Then run gogo "install platform" to download the newest Windows and/or Mac modules.
</li></ul>
<a name="3.0_Overview" id="3.0_Overview"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> 3.0 Overview </span></h2>
<ul><li> Currently release supports Windows, Mac, iPhone/iPad, and Android.
</li><li> Modular - "gogo install" installs only platforms and libraries you want.
</li><li> Source code access - you can install "windows-project" and/or "mac-project" to tweak the Plasmacore source as you like.  If you don't need that power you can just download the "windows" and/or "mac" platforms which are precompiled.
</li></ul>
<a name="Using_GoGo" id="Using_GoGo"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Using GoGo </span></h2>
<ul><li> Windows: type "gogo" in the base project directory (you'll need to repeat several times as it installs libraries for you).
</li><li> Mac: type "chmod a+rx gogo" and then type "./gogo" in the base project directory (you'll need to repeat several times as it installs libraries for you).
</li></ul>
<a name="Change_Log_for_v3.0.11_.28May_22.2C_2010.29" id="Change_Log_for_v3.0.11_.28May_22.2C_2010.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Change Log for v3.0.11 (May 22, 2010) </span></h2>
<ul><li> Added <a href="slagdoc_webview.html" title="SlagDoc:WebView">WebView</a> functionality to iPhone and Android Plasmacore.
</li><li> Added implicit property declarations into inline classes.  By example, this code:
</li></ul>
<pre> local var a = 5
 local var x = 6
 script.add( Command(a,x,7) with
   PROPERTIES
     a, b, c&nbsp;: Int32
   METHODS
     method init( a, b, c ):
     method execute.Logical:
       println( "a:$ b:$ c:$" (a,b,c) )
       return false
 endWith )
</pre>
<dl><dd> can be written with this shorthand notation:
</dd></dl>
<pre> script.add( Command(Int32 a,Int32 b=x, Int32 c=7) with
   method execute.Logical:
       println( "a:$ b:$ c:$" (a,b,c) )
       return false
 endWith )
</pre>
<dl><dd> In other words, listing a parameter type during an inline class declaration creates a property of the same name in the class.  If no "default value" (e.g. =7) is given, an existing value of the same name must exist to be sent in as an initializer parameter.
</dd></dl>
<ul><li> Reversed Script (in script.slag) update logic once more.  Script::update() returns true if it's still running or false if it's done.  Command::execute() should return true if it needs to run again or false if it's finished.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Added a <i>first:Logical</i> property to script class Command intended for use in <i>execute()</i>.  The code "if (first)" will return "true" the first time and "false" successive times (<i>first</i> becomes "false" as soon as you read its value).
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Added "CmdGroup" to the script library that allows several commands to be run concurrently.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Added Box::clamped(Box outer).Box.  It repositions and, if necessary, resizes a box to fit within an <i>outer</i> box.  For example: "pos = window.bounding_box.clamped(Display.bounding_box).position".
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Added a <a href="custom_native_functionality.html#SlagNativePtr" title="Custom Native Functionality">NativeDataPtr</a> system to the runtime that makes it easy to embed pointers to native data into Slag objects.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Reworked the mechanism for Screen <i>push()</i>, <i>pop()</i> and <i>replace_with()</i> to make it more robust.  Before, you could encounter unexpected behavior if you called <i>replace_with()</i> in the constructor of another Screen that was itself replacing another screen.  You don't have to be careful when you call these methods anymore.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Changed String::urlencode().String to String::url_encoded().String in web.slag.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Fixed bug where any local Int32 "x&nbsp;% 1" would result in 1 where it should have been 0.  This bug only occurred for local variables and only when modded with 1.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Fixed bug where images whose render_flags included Render.tile_mode were incorrectly positioned on iPhone.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Fixed Android sound bugs: 1) stopped music restarts instead of resuming, and 2) when an app is paused and resumed, the music that was playing resumes playback.
</li></ul>
<a name="Change_Log_for_v3.0.10" id="Change_Log_for_v3.0.10"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Change Log for v3.0.10 </span></h2>
<ul><li> Added revamped Android support.  See <a href="plasmacore_android_projects.html" title="Plasmacore:Android Projects">Android Projects</a> for details.
</li><li> project.properties has been added to the iPhone project.  If you already have an Xcode project, you can manually add it as a resource so that Plasmacore respects its settings.
</li><li> Added Bitmap::init(Int32 width, Int32 height, Color fill_color).
</li><li> Added image recovery system for Android (which loses textures when switching apps and doesn't have enough memory to cache them):
<ul><li> Load your images using extended ImageGroup singletons and your sounds using extended SoundGroup singletons (images and sounds should be separate since sounds aren't lost).
</li><li> When texture data is lost, Plasmacore automatically calls <i>unload()</i> on each ImageGroup and then queues it for loading again.
</li><li> Application.image_reload_handler is a special Screen that is displayed when images are reloading.  By default it will draw a simple loading bar but you can set it to a different Screen if you like.
</li><li> The screen's <i>on_activate()</i> method is called when images are lost to allow it to reload a custom background etc.
</li><li> The screen's <i>update()</i> and <i>draw()</i> methods are continually called (instead of those of the normally active screens) until ResourceManager.progress == 1.0.
</li></ul>
</li><li> "gogo clean" is now the same thing as "gogo xclean".  All intermediate and output files are removed, leaving only the essential project files.
</li><li> The CompositeImage class has additional functionality:
<ul><li> As before, create with CompositeImage("filename.png") to load up an image and break it into 256x256 pixel chunks underneath to allow large images to more easily fit on texture sheets and be compatible with more video cards.
</li><li> Create a CompositeImage(w,h) to create an image that logically acts as a canvas of the given size.
</li><li> Call <i>add(img,x,y)</i> to add an image to a certain (x,y) location.  It will be drawn there (relative to the entire image) when the composite image is drawn.
</li><li> Override <i>draw()</i> to draw your own images anywhere you would like relative to the top-left corner of the CompositeImage.
</li><li> Rotate and scale the CompositeImage as you like.
</li><li> Example of use: extend ControlPanel from CompositeImage.  Override its <i>draw()</i> to draw buttons and such in individual locations relative to the corner of the control panel.  Then just draw your ControlPanel instance to (x,y) to have the whole thing be drawn at (x,y).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The previous version changed PLASMACORE_MAX_TOUCHES to be 10 for iPad, but in TouchManager the <i>touches</i> array was still fixed at 5.  More than 5 simultaneous touches on iPad would likely crash the program - this has been fixed.
</li><li> Fixed compiler bug in reading lists of ranges.  Commands like "forEach (d in {2,3..sqrt(n) step 2})" now work again.
</li><li> Fixed compiler bug - the logicalizing operator now works properly with compounds, so "if (pos?)" where <i>pos</i> is a Vector2 now compiles correctly.
</li><li> Fixed significant (but generally not fatal) bug where base class properties with initial value assignments were being initialized as part of the base class initialization AND every extended class initialization.  The primary error that resulted from this was any initial expression containing a calculation involving literal values would inadvertently have constant folding performed twice on the same nodes, for example resulting in "1.0/256.0" when "1.0/16.0" was desired.
</li><li> Fixed instanceOf, which was not working correctly at all.
</li><li> Fixed clipping region to work on Windows.
</li><li> Fixed Font::word_wrap() to count an empty string as a single blank line instead of no lines.
</li><li> Display.screen_shot().Bitmap now works on Windows as well as the other platforms.  Example: "File("test.png").save(Display.screen_shot.to_png_bytes)".
</li></ul>
<a name="Change_Log_for_v3.0.9" id="Change_Log_for_v3.0.9"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Change Log for v3.0.9 </span></h2>
<ul><li> Added new <a href="slagdoc_file.html" title="SlagDoc:File">File</a> methods <a href="slagdoc_file.html#with_forward_slashes" title="SlagDoc:File">with_forward_slashes()</a>, <a href="slagdoc_file.html#with_back_slashes" title="SlagDoc:File">with_back_slashes()</a>, and <a href="slagdoc_file.html#with_os_slashes" title="SlagDoc:File">with_os_slashes()</a>.
</li><li> Added a <i>position:Vector2</i> property to class Image. For convenience you can set an image's position separately and then just call <i>draw()</i>.
</li><li> Filled out every combination of intersects() and contains() with the common shapes (Vector2, Line, Box, Quad, Circle).
</li><li> Added <i>contains()</i> tests for Box(Line), Box(Quad), Box(Circle), Quad(Vector2), Quad(Box), Quad(Quad), and Quad(circle).
</li><li> Added <i>intersects()</i> tests for Box+Quad, Box+Circle, Quad+Quad, Quad+Circle, and Line+Quad.
</li><li> Added <i>rotated(angle)</i> methods for Line, Box, and Quad.
</li><li> The difference (subtraction) of two Degrees or two Radians values now results in a normalized "shortest angle" between -180 and 180 (or -pi and pi).  For example, Degrees(0) - Degrees(270) gives Degrees(90).
</li><li> Added Vector2::magnitude_squared(); useful for comparing two relative distances without using expensive square root.
</li><li> Added multi-touch mouse position state support. "Input.mouse_position" returns the position of mouse #1 (as before), while "Input.mouse_position(i)" returns the position of mouse #i (where i is 1 to 10).
</li><li> Added ParseReader::consume_ws().Logical that consumes any pending whitespace.
</li><li> Added Display.scale_to_fit(new_width,new_height).  For example, to scale and center your game within a 320x480 area, call Display.scale_to_fit(320,480).
</li><li> Added Display.screen_border as a special Screen that gets updated and drawn every frame.  It will draw black borders when necessary as a result of Display.scale_to_fit().
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Changed AnimatedImage::animator() to AnimatedImage::create_animator().
</li><li> Changes to AnimatedImage:
<ul><li> "AnimatedImage" has been renamed to "Animation". "Animator" has been renamed to "AnimatedImage".  The new names are used below.
</li><li> Call Animation::create_animated_image().AnimatedImage to obtain an instance of the Animation that behaves like an Image.
</li><li> Animation is no longer a GenericImage, so you can no longer set the handle (etc.).  Those sorts of operations may only be performed on AnimatedImage.
</li><li> There are now three initializers in animation.  They take a filename, an existing image, and an existing arraylist of Image frames, respectively.
</li><li> AnimatedImage::update().Logical now returns "true" if the animation is still playing or "false" if it's stopped, which is opposite from before.
</li><li> AnimatedImage now respects its <i>hflip</i> and <i>flip</i> flags when it's drawn.
</li><li> AnimatedImage::size().Vector2 now returns the pixel size of the first frame in the Animation (instead of 0x0).
</li></ul>
</li><li> str.to_Real64() now handles exponent notation ("3.2e10").
</li><li> Renamed MD5.convertMD5(String).String to MD5.to_md5(String).string.
</li><li> Significant changes to Entity system:
<ul><li> Stopped trying to make all things possible with single very generic system.  Separated Entity system into two specialized parts: Entity, which concerns things being drawn on screen, and Script, which runs through a series of Command nodes. In particular, support was removed for having chained inactive entities which activate after previous entities die - that was ultimately just too complex.
</li><li> Most event-handler callbacks (on_activate, on_death) removed from Entity since Entities are presumed always active.  Write your entity setup in its initializer method and write its death code in its <i>die()</i> method (before calling prior.die).
</li><li> If you include "script.slag" you can create a Script() and then add one or more Command nodes to it.  Ensure <i>update()</i> is called on your script every update.  See script.slag for some examples of commands.  Command ScriptLoop is not tested yet.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Fixed bug where setting the handle of an Image to an actual Handle compound with a relative value (Handle(0,0,Handle.bottom_right)) wouldn't take effect.  This showed up primarily when trying to set the handle of an Animator.
</li><li> Fixed iPhone Plasmacore to 1) locate project.properties correctly and 2) respect the DISPLAY_ORIENTATION from that file.
</li><li> Fixed bug where ResourceManager wouldn't load anything - its <i>update()</i> method wasn't getting called from the EventManager's "update" event handler.
</li><li> Fixed bug in Display.region().Box.
</li><li> Fixed bug in keeping consistent mouse id's between multitouch events on the iPhone.
</li><li> Removed accidental include of test sound effect in iPhone project.
</li></ul>
<a name="Change_Log_for_v3.0.8" id="Change_Log_for_v3.0.8"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Change Log for v3.0.8 </span></h2>
<ul><li> Added List&lt;&lt;String&gt;&gt;::join(String joiner="\n").  Concatenates a list or arraylist of strings into a single string, inserting <i>joiner</i> in-between every pair.
</li><li> Fixed bug: if a type that requires cleanup is referenced (as with a property) but never instantiated, the loader no longer throws an error when it can't find that class's <i>clean_up()</i> method (since it's been culled out).
</li><li> Fixed bug that would confuse methods with the same name but different numbers of parameters in a generic ArrayList during call resolution.
</li><li> Fixed concurrent modification errors dispatching events when a SystemEvent (GC) would happen during an <i>update</i> or other event.
</li><li> Fixed bug that where deferred singletons weren't accessed correctly in some common situations and would throw a null reference error.
</li><li> Fixed bug in Font::word_wrap(String,Int32 pixel_width).String[].
</li></ul>
<a name="Upgrading_from_v2.24_or_v2.30_Beta" id="Upgrading_from_v2.24_or_v2.30_Beta"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Upgrading from v2.24 or v2.30 Beta </span></h2>
<ul><li> Refactored Slag compiler is 4 to 7 times faster across the board.
</li><li> Both VM and cross-compiled builds are notably faster due to inlining.
</li><li> Templates can now accept arbitrary code as a substitution value, very much like a macro.  For example, to sort a list of names by last name: list.sort( CompareFn&lt;&lt;Name,a.last &lt; b.last&gt;&gt; ).
</li><li> Plasmacore is a much more open and flexible framework instead of the closed "black box" it has been.  It's easy to add custom native libraries and such.
</li><li> For more info on adding custom functionality, see <a href="custom_native_functionality.html" title="Custom Native Functionality">Custom Native Functionality</a>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Place the new_project folder from v3.0 in the upgrade/ folder of your existing project.  Run gogo or ant to upgrade.<br />
</li><li> After upgrading, delete all Slag library files in the src/ directory (plasmacore.slag, standard.slag, scoreboard.slag, etc.).  These have been moved to libraries/slag.  You don't have to adjust any of your paths.  Your own source code should remain in the src/ folder.<br />
</li><li> Multimethods are gone in favor of compile speed.  It's back to double dispatch tricks!
</li><li> Template placeholder names must now always start with a '$' character.  "class Grid&lt;&lt;SquareType&gt;&gt;... method set(SquareType square):" must become "class Grid&lt;&lt;$SquareType&gt;&gt;... method set($SquareType square):".<br />
</li><li> Change all calls to <i>underlying</i> to be <i>insertUnderlying</i> instead. <i>insertUnderlying</i> can no longer (for now) be used as an expression, meaning you can't say "return insertUnderlying" or send arbitrary arguments with "insertUnderlying(a,b,c)" - it has to be just "insertUnderlying" and the original arguments are always implicitly sent.<br />
</li><li> Display and input-related methods and metrics have been moved out of class Application and Screen.  Application.bg_color is now Display.background_color.  A screen's size is now Display.size.  fullscreen, clipping_region, etc. is now in Display, and input-related display settings (mouse_visible, keyboard_visible) have been moved to Input.<br />
</li><li> A Plasmacore app no longer starts at an extended Application. Instead, the Screen class has been revamped to be a combination view, controller, and gamestate.  In can be used in all kinds of new useful ways, but happily only slight changes are required to adapt an old project.  Change your main file along the following lines:
</li></ul>
<pre> # Old code
 class Main&nbsp;: Application
   method init:
     GameView()
 endClass
 
 class GameView&nbsp;: Screen ...
</pre>
<pre> # New code
 class Main&nbsp;: Screen
   method init:
     replace_with( GameView() )
 endClass
 
 class GameView&nbsp;: Screen ...
</pre>
<ul><li> Screens are no longer InputDispatchers - they no longer support individual transforms and hence all use the same mouse and rendering information.  1) Use Input.mouse_position instead of any specific Screen's mouse_position.  2) Any input listeners can listen(Input) instead of listening to any specific Screen, or you can incorporate InputDispatcher into your Screen class and have it work as before.<br />
</li><li> Platform-specific libraries are no longer included by default on either the Slag side or the native side for all platforms.  If you use IPhone methods, for instance, you should [include "iphone.slag"] in your main file.  Now there's another change: the IPhone (etc.) native calls only work correctly if you're running on iPhone.  Change code that directly calls platform-specific code with a System.os check or a [if defined(...)]...[endIf] directive.  For instance:
</li></ul>
<pre> # Old code
 IPhone.enable_auto_dimming = false
</pre>
<pre> # New code
 if (System.os == "iphone") IPhone.enable_auto_dimming = false
</pre>
<p>or
</p>
<pre> [if defined(IPHONE)] IPhone.enable_auto_dimming = false [endIf]
</pre>
<ul><li> Note that iPad defines both IPAD and IPHONE.<br />
</li><li> Box2D and many other "non-essential" libraries are no longer included by default. They are still included in the distribution at the moment, though in the near future they may become separate downloads.  Plasmacore now comes with Mac and Windows project files (for recompiling Plasmacore) and there is now a simple, standard way to include extra functionality.  To include Box2D in Mac Plasmacore, open platforms/mac/plasmacore_mac.xcodeproj in Xcode.  Follow the instructions in the header of libraries/native/plasmacore/box2d/box2d_core.h and recompile - the version of Mac Plasmacore that gets used when you type "gogo build" will be replaced.  Note that your changes to platforms/mac/main.mm are preserved when you upgrade Plasmacore.<br />
</li><li> Semicolons are no longer allowed instead of colons on methods without an empty body.  If desired you can use the <i>noAction</i> (no-op) to indicate that a method body has been purposely left blank.  For example:
</li></ul>
<pre> # Old code
 method zombie_conga( party );
</pre>
<pre> # New code
 method zombie_conga( party ):
</pre>
<p>or
</p>
<pre> method zombie_conga( party ): noAction
</pre>
<ul><li> Templates can now accept arbitrary bits of code, similar to macros.  The HeapSort ascending/descending mechanism has been replaced.  By default it still sorts into ascending order, or you can send in a CompareFn object that defines when <i>a</i> should come before <i>b</i>, like this:
</li></ul>
<pre> HeapSort&lt;&lt;FarmItem&gt;&gt;.sort( collideList, CompareFn&lt;&lt;FarmItem,a &gt; b&gt;&gt;() )  # sorts into ascending order

<p>Note that this allows for easily sorting on object properties rather than relying on op==() and op&lt;&gt;(), like this:
